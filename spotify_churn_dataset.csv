# Spotify User Analysis (Churn & Ads) — Power BI + SQL + Excel

#Short description:
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify user churn, ad exposure, and subscription behavior. Includes cleaned dataset, SQL queries used for analysis, and dashboard screenshots.

#Highlights / Key Metrics (from dashboard)
- Churned users: 2,071  
- Avg ads per week: 6.94  
- Churn rate:25.89%  
- Active hours: 5,929  
- Top churn age-group:36–50

# Project Structure
- `images/` — dashboard screenshots
- `data/spotify_cleaned.xlsx` — cleaned dataset (anonymized)
- `sql/queries.sql` — SQL queries used for analysis
- `report/` — Power BI `.pbix` file (optional)

#How to reproduce
1. Open `data/spotify_cleaned.xlsx` to inspect the cleaned data.
2. Run queries in `sql/queries.sql` (adjust connection details).
3. Open `report/Spotify_report.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to view dashboards.

#Insights & Actionable Recommendations
1. High churn (25.9%) — target retention campaigns for high-risk cohorts (36–50).  
2. Ad frequency correlated with churn — test reduced ad exposure or personalized ad capping for premium prospects.  
3. Similar skip rates across genders — focus personalization by behavior/age rather than gender.  
4. Next steps: predictive churn model (logistic regression), cohort LTV, A/B test ad frequency.

#Tools & Stack
